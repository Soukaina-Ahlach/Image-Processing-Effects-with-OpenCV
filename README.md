# Image Processing Effects with OpenCV

A C++ project that demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV. The project applies effects like Gaussian blur, watercolor, pencil sketch, and custom color filters to showcase OpenCV's capabilities for image manipulation and computer vision.

## Features
- **Gaussian Blur**: Smooths the image using a Gaussian kernel.
- **Watercolor Effect**: Combines bilateral filtering and median blurring to simulate a watercolor painting.
- **Pencil Sketch**: Converts images into pencil sketch effects, both in grayscale and color.
- **Color Filter Sketch**: Applies a gradient color filter followed by a pencil sketch effect.
